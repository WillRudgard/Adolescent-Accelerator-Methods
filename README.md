This repository contains a step-by-step guide for evaluating the association between multiple protective factors and multiple adolescent development outcomes. The code includes Stata syntax and R Script necessary to undertake a descriptive analysis of hypothesised protective factors, investigate correlations between protective factors, and generate regression results accounting for correlations between multiple outcomes. To run the code, you will need the 20210608 “Plos Medicine INSPIRE dta Formatted” data file, which can be requested by contacting William Rudgard at william.rudgard@spi.ox.ac.uk.
