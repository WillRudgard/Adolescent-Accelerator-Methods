This repository contains a step-by-step guide for evaluating the association between protective factors and multiple adolescent development outcomes, and estimating the additive improvements in development outcomes from experiencing multiple protective factors. The code includes Stata syntax and R Script necessary to undertake a descriptive analysis of hypothesised protective factors, investigate correlations between protective factors, and generate regression results accounting for correlations between multiple outcomes. To run the code, you will need the “Plos Medicine INSPIRE dta Formatted” data file, which can be requested by contacting William Rudgard at william.rudgard@spi.ox.ac.uk. This work is part of the UKRI GCRF Accelerating Achievement for Africa's Adolescents Hub. For more information, visit: https://www.acceleratehub.org/
